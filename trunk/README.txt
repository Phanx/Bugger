Bugger
=========

Bugger is a basic GUI front-end for !BugGrabber using the default UI's
error frame with some modifications.

It should currently be considered a rough beta. It may have bugs, and
it's definitely incomplete and unpolished.

Broker icon:

* Click to toggle the error window.
* Alt-click to clear all saved errors.
* Ctrl-click to reload the UI.

Error window:

* Click the previous/next buttons to browse through the errors.
* Shift-click the previous/next buttons to jump to the first/last error.

Features that exist in BugSack that will not be added to Bugger
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Automatic popup of the window when an error occurs.
* Sending errors to other players. I've never used this feature or
  known anyone who did.
* Searching for text in errors. If you have so many errors you need a
  search feature, you're probably doing something wrong.


Why it was written
---------------------

There were a number of things that have long annoyed me about BugSack,
but I have no interest in battling with another addon author, so it was
easier just to write my own addon than try to fix/change anything in
BugSack. If you're happy with BugSack, go ahead and keep using it; it's not broken!


Localization
---------------

* Compatible with all languages.
* Translated into English, Deutsch, and Espa√±ol.
* Corrections and additions welcome.


Feedback
-----------

Post a comment on WoWInterface, or submit a ticket on CurseForge. If
you are reporting a problem, be specific -- tell me which version of
the addon you're using, which servers you're on (live/beta), which
Broker  display you're using, what steps I should follow to reproduce
the  problem, whether it happens with other addons disabled, and the
full text of any related error messages.

If you need to contact me privately, you can send me a private message
on either download site, or email me at <addons@phanx.net>.

similar, so credits go to all the current and past authors of BugSack,
including Funkydude, Rabbit, Archarodim, Zidomo, Rowne, Ramble, kergoth,
ckknight, Gamefaq, thomasmo, damjau, and Fritti.
